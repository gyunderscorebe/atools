# Admin tools for AssaultCube

## Features

* Provides commands that claim admin automatically: ban, kick, ban by name, ban by ip, etc.
* Provides a menu through which it's possible to list servers you have admin on so that the script can figure out which password to use automatically.

## Reference

Read the top of `atools.cfg`.

## Installation

Download `atools.cfg` and put it into `config/` directory and add `exec config/atools.cfg` to `autoexec.cfg`.

## TODO
